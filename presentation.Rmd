## Defining preregistration

> Specifying your research plan in advance of your study and submitting it to a registry.

**Goal:** Separating hypothesis-generating (exploratory) from hypothesis-testing (confirmatory) research. 

Subgoals:

* Planning tool
* Improve quality and transparency
* Clearly report your study
* Set boundaries for agreed-upon work (PhD student, statistical collaborator)

## Working reproducibly

WORCS: A Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science [www.developmentaldatascience.org/worcs](www.developmentaldatascience.org/worcs)

1. Dynamic document generation
    * Rmarkdown paper includes prose and analysis code
    * Paper can be reproduced / results updated with one click
2. Version control
    * Git tracks all changes since start of project
    * Project can be public on GitHub
    * Tag "release": Time capsule at specific stage of project, e.g. "pre-registration"
3. Dependency management
    * Record or container with all software needed to reproduce

## Preregistration in WORCS

1. Complete a prereg template in Rmarkdown format `prereg.Rmd`
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Tag the release as `preregistration`
4. Optional: Render Rmarkdown to PDF and upload to OSF.io / aspredicted.org
5. Collect data
6. Write `manuscript.Rmd` with planned analyses

## Shortcomings of preregistrations

* Extra work
* Residual ambiguity
    + Unintentional
    + Strategic
* Straight-jacket: Can "force" researcher to stick with bad plans
* Researchers often not trained in preregistration
    + In neither writing nor reviewing thereof
* Not all preregistration templates are relevant for all research (e.g., secondary analysis)
* Difficult to compare with final manuscript, because they are in different formats

## Solution: PAC

1. Preregister Rmarkdown with draft of manuscript
2. Include code for planned analyses
3. Use fake$^*$ data to obtain preliminary results
4. Draft report based on preliminary results

After collecting real data

5. Re-compile Rmarkdown and see final results
6. Write Results and Discussion

$*$ = Simulated, or synthetic, or from prior study, or shuffle some real data!

## Advantages

* Extra work
    + You're not writing a separate document, but an early version of the final manuscript
    + You need to write code to analyze the data anyway
* Ambiguity
    + Unintentional: You become aware of ambiguity in your planned analysis when you start actually running it 
    + Strategic: Reduced; there's a straightforward game plan
* Straight-jacket: Can "force" researcher to stick with bad plans
    + You can deviate from planned analyses; create a Git commit with the changes

## Advantages 2

* Researchers often not trained in preregistration
    + But we are trained in writing papers! Sticking with that format is easier to write and review
* Not all preregistration templates are relevant for all research (e.g., secondary analysis)
    + Writing a preregistration as draft manuscript ensures all sections are directly relevant
* Difficult to compare with final manuscript, because they are in different formats
    + You can literally compare the two versions (using Git diff) to see how the planned analyses were executed
    
## Example

## Limitations

* Can't cover all contingencies; deviations will be necessary
    + Version control makes clear what has changed
* Simulating data is difficult/requires much effort
    + But super useful, e.g. power analysis
    + Statistical co-author
    + Collect data first, shuffle dependent variable
* Requires reproducible/reusable workflow
    + But this ensures correctness/reliability/reusability of your work
* Preregistration forms may be more detailed / complement information in manuscript
    + What can we learn from prereg forms to improve our manuscripts?
# Problem 2 --- Writing a Preregistration

## Conclusion

Preregistration As Code may have advantages

* Same format as paper
* Unambiguous
* Easy to compare prereg VS final version
* Power analysis etc

But... they require training in reproducibility and statistical programming that is not yet commonplace

So: A vision of the future of preregistration?
